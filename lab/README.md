# Event Flow & Delegation — Exercise
## Purpose

This folder contains a small, self-contained exercise that lets you apply previously learned concepts of DOM event propagation (capturing → target → bubbling) and event delegation. You will use a starter todo-list app to practice handling events and updating the DOM.

## Contents

- index.html — starter todo-list app for the exercise

- exercise.js / files/ — starter JavaScript and exercise instructions

- styles.css — optional, for app styling if separated

- assets/ — diagrams and images

- test/ / __test__.js — automated tests and grading guidance

## Quick Start

- Open index.html in a browser.

- Follow instructions in exercise.md and complete the exercise.

## Testing

Run npm test (if configured) or check labtests/ for guidance.
