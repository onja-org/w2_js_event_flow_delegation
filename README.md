# 🎓 JavaScript Event Flow & Delegation Lab

## 🎯 What You\'ll Learn

In this hands-on lab, you\'ll master two crucial concepts in JavaScript DOM events:

1. **Event Flow** - Understanding how events travel through the DOM:
   - Capturing phase (top → down)
   - Target phase (element itself)
   - Bubbling phase (bottom → up)

2. **Event Delegation** - Writing efficient event handlers:
   - Handle multiple elements with a single listener
   - Manage dynamically added elements automatically
   - Improve performance and memory usage

## 📚 Lab Content

- **Interactive Demo**: A todo list application showcasing event flow
- **Visual Diagrams**: Clear illustrations of event phases
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Implement delegation patterns yourself
- **Test Suite**: Verify your implementation works correctly

## 🎮 Getting Started

1. **Read the Lesson**
   - Start with \`lesson/README.md\` for core concepts
   - Study the event flow diagram in \`assets/\`

2. **Try the Exercise**
   - Open \`lab/exercise.md\` for instructions
   - Follow the step-by-step guide
   - Use the browser console to see events in action

3. **Test Your Work**
   - Manual testing: Use browser DevTools console
   - Automated testing: Run the test suite (see \`test/\`)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you\'ll be able to:

- Understand event capturing, target, and bubbling phases
- Use \`stopPropagation()\` and \`preventDefault()\` effectively
- Implement efficient event delegation patterns
- Handle dynamic content with minimal event listeners
- Debug event flow using browser DevTools

## 💡 Tips for Success

- Open DevTools console while working (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
- Watch the event flow logs as you interact with the page
- Try adding new items to see delegation in action
- Experiment with different event phases
